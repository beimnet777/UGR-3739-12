            There is something magical about sliding on clunky boots and tromping through leaves, sticks and dirt. 
            Hiking has played a huge role in molding who I have become. Since I can remember my family and I have gone on hiking and camping trips.
            Hiking has taught me many valuable life lessons. It has taught me how to live in the moment, enjoy the simple things, love dirty sweat and live without technology for a week or two.
            Hiking has so much to offer people once they get past the idea of spiders, ticks, snakes and poison ivy. Some common benefits hiking has to offer anyone is reduced depression, weight control, muscle strength, cardiovascular and slows aging process. Who knew one could reap so many benefits from a hobby.</p></div>
    <div role="card"><div></div><p>Charity<br>There is a proverb: ‘Charity begins at home.’ A per­son, who is kind at heart and possesses compassion from his early days towards the weak and the needy in the society, is generally found to help and make gifts to the poor. He finds joy and satisfaction in giving alms to a beggar, or renders some financial relief to the needy persons who are near at hand.
        Thus charity begins at home. In other words, it begins in the near neighbourhoods of a person. One first comes forward to help his neighbours, relatives and friends in the very beginning. Afterwards, he extends his, same helping hand to the distant places, where thousands of the needy and the weak people await his help and sympathy.
        Charity, a noble quality in man, brings welfare in the society. It enlarges human hearts and spreads the message of brotherhood and innocent love among the people.</p></div>
    <div role="card"><div></div><p>BASKETBALL<br>basket ball 
        When it is played for fun or pleasure, the very basic element of basketball is to aim the ball so that it passes through a basket that is hung on a height. It can be played between two players who are practicing against each other. For this sometimes even one basket is enough. But more seriously or professionally it is played between two teams of five players each. Each team has a side on the court and it has to score by hitting the basket of the opponent team.</p></div>
