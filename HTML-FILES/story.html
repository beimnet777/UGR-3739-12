            <p role="short story" id="para">Hi My name is Beimnet Bekele. I am a student in my Addis Ababa University. I
                am also the youngest child in my family. I have two older brothers and two older sisters. My mum is a
                full time housewife and my dad is a doctor.
                It is a common knowledge that I am a good student and I love to study a lot. My favorite courses are
                data structure, Web development and object oriented programming. I’m what a lot of people call a geek. I
                have every intention of applying to a reputable
                university and obtaining a degree with great destiniction.
                I am responsible and hardworking, so I study hard to obtain good grades I have always been treated like
                a baby, by my parents, siblings, teachers and basically everyone who is not in my age group. Sometimes
                even my friends talk to me like I am a child, which is
                why I basically love school and reading books. Books don’t talk back at you and they make me feel
                important in this gigantic universe.My favorite thing to do is to play basketball When it is played for
                fun or pleasure, the very basic element of basketball is to aim the ball
                so that it passes through a basket that is hung on a height. It can be played between two players who
                are practicing against each other. For this sometimes even one basket is enough. But more seriously or
                professionally it is played between two teams of five players each.
                Each team has a side on the court and it has to score by hitting the basket of the opponent team.The
                best project i have participated is the one that focuses on api.This project involves developing a web
                application that uses search inputs and Giphy API for presenting GIFs
                on a webpage. This is an excellent beginner-level project wherein you use the Giphy API to recreate the
                Giphy website. We recommend you to use the Giphy API since you need not request for any API key to use
                it. Another advantage of using the Giphy API is that you don’t require to worry about configuration
                while requesting data.
                You can use the Giphy API to build a web application that has a search input where users can search for
                specific GIFs, can display trending GIFs in a column/grid format, and has a load more option at the
                bottom for searching more GIFs. </p>
