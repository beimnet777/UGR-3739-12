        <div role="card"><div></div><p>Undergraduate<br>My undergraduate course has given me a comprehensive knowledge of the basic areas in Computer Science 
            Engineering such as Computer Organization, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Computer Networks, Language 
            Processors and Artificial Intelligence. I was involved in projects implementing the principles of Operating Systems,
             Computer Networks and Language Processors using C and C++. I am proficient in languages such as JAVA, C, HTML, and
             packages like MS Office, databases like ORACLE, and operating systems like MS-DOS, UNIX, Linux, Windows and designing
             languages like UML</p></div>
    <div role="card"><div></div><p>Bachlors<br>While the undergraduate courses enabled me to grasp the fundamentals related to Computer Science Engineering, 
        they do not present an opportunity to thoroughly understand the technologies that are current within the industry.
         Therefore, while a Bachelorâ€™s degree provides a sound alternative to taking a direct leap from schooling fundamentals 
        to industry standards, it is still insufficient for an engineer to analyze the professional world. I feel the need to 
        take up graduate study, as it would bring me closer to the kind of technical expertise I require to fulfill 
        my professional desires.</p></div>
    <div role="card"><div></div><p>University<br>I am convinced that Addis Ababa is the right place to further my academic career. Your eminent faculty, 
        excellent research facilities, the courses offered in your university are very much likely to produce excellent
         results to the fields of my interest. especially Your university is a confluence of people from varied culture,
         nationality, religion, race and ideology. I am sure that my exposure to these kinds of diverse influences would 
        result in the overall development of my personality and help me broaden my concept from the narrower confines of 
        nationalism to internationalism. I would therefore be very thankful if I am offered a beneficial association with 
        your esteemed university with full financial support.</p></div>
    <div role="card"><div></div><p>Further Studies<br>Having learnt from the past, I live in the present with an eye on the future. My foremost dream in life is to be 
        acknowledged and congratulated for my academic achievements. This desire is the main motivation in me wanting to 
        pursuemy next step. I want to reach the peak in Computing and Information Technology 
        space. In this Ever-changing world of Computer Technology, where each new day sees a spate of new concepts and trends
         emerging, I want to stay on fast track.</p></div>
